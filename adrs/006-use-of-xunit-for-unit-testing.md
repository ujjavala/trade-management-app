# ADR 006: Use of xUnit for Unit Testing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a robust unit testing framework to ensure the correctness of the business logic and data access. xUnit is a popular testing framework for .NET applications.

## Decision
We decided to use xUnit for unit testing in the Tests project.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - Provides a rich set of features for unit testing.
  - Integrates well with .NET applications and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Supports parallel test execution.
- **Cons**:
  - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with xUnit.
  - Requires additional configuration for test setup and teardown.
