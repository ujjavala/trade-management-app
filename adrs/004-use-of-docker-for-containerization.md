# ADR 004: Use of Docker for Containerization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a consistent and reproducible environment for development, testing, and deployment. Docker provides a solution for containerizing applications.

## Decision
We decided to use Docker for containerizing the application and its dependencies.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - Consistent environment across development, testing, and production.
  - Simplifies dependency management and deployment.
  - Supports scalability and orchestration with Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
- **Cons**:
  - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Docker.
  - Potential performance overhead compared to running directly on the host machine.
