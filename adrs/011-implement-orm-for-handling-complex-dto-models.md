# ADR 011: Implement ORM for Handling Complex DTO Models

## Status
Pending

## Context
To manage complex Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and their relationships, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool is required. Entity Framework Core is a suitable choice for this purpose.

## Decision
We are considering implementing an ORM using Entity Framework Core to handle complex DTO models.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - Simplifies data access and manipulation.
  - Ensures consistency across the application.
  - Supports advanced features like lazy loading and change tracking.
- **Cons**:
  - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Entity Framework Core.
  - Potential performance overhead compared to raw SQL queries.
