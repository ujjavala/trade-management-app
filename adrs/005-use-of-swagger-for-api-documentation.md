# ADR 005: Use of Swagger for API Documentation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires comprehensive API documentation to facilitate development and testing. Swagger is a widely used tool for generating interactive API documentation.

## Decision
We decided to use Swagger for API documentation in the API Layer.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - Provides interactive API documentation.
  - Simplifies testing and debugging of API endpoints.
  - Automatically generates documentation from code annotations.
- **Cons**:
  - Additional configuration required to set up Swagger.
  - Potential security risks if sensitive endpoints are exposed in the documentation.
