# ADR 010: Implement Authentication Layer

## Status
Pending

## Context
To secure the API endpoints, an authentication layer is required. This will ensure that only authorized users can access the API.

## Decision
We are considering implementing an authentication layer using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - Enhances the security of the API.
  - Supports fine-grained access control.
  - Integrates well with existing authentication providers.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires additional configuration and management.
  - Potential complexity in implementing and maintaining the authentication layer.
