# ADR 012: Fix Integration Tests

## Status
Pending

## Context
The integration tests are currently failing due to platform dependencies. These tests need to be reviewed and fixed to ensure they are working correctly with the new architecture.

## Decision
We are considering reviewing and fixing the integration tests to ensure they work correctly with the new architecture.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - Ensures the correctness of the integration between different components.
  - Improves the reliability of the application.
  - Identifies potential issues early in the development process.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires additional effort to review and fix the tests.
  - Potential complexity in managing platform dependencies.
